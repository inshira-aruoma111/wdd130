            <p>Hi! my name is Ariaghosa Blessing Aruoma and I am from Benin city, Nigeria. I love learning new things. 
                I am currently studying to become a web developer, one of the reason
                 I took this as a challenge was because I was told its a man's job.
                 I intend proving alot of people wrong that anyone can do great things inasmuch as we put our minds to it. </p>
